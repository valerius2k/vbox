/** @page pg_bs3kit BS3Kit - Boot Sector 3 Kit
 *
 * The BS3Kit is a framework for bare metal floppy/usb image tests.
 *
 * The 3rd iteration of the framework includes support for 16-bit and 32-bit
 * C/C++ code, with provisions for 64-bit C code to possibly be added later.
 * The C code have to do without a runtime library, otherwhat what we can share
 * possibly with IPRT.
 *
 * This iteration also adds a real linker into the picture, which is an
 * improvment over early when all had to done in a single assembler run with
 * lots of includes and macros controlling what we needed.  The functions are no
 * in separate files and compiled/assembled into libraries, so the linker will
 * only include exactly what is needed.  The current linker is the OpenWatcom
 * one, wlink, that we're already using when building the BIOSes.  If it wasn't
 * for the segment/selector fixups in 16-bit code (mostly), maybe we could
 * convince the ELF linker from GNU binutils to do the job too (with help from
 * the ).
 *
 *
 *
 * @section sec_calling_convention      Calling convention
 *
 * Because we're not mixing with C code, we will use __cdecl for 16-bit and
 * 32-bit code, where as 64-bit code will use the microsoft calling AMD64
 * convention.  To avoid unnecessary %ifdef'ing in assembly code, we will use a
 * macro to load the RCX, RDX, R8 and R9 registers off the stack in 64-bit
 * assembly code.
 *
 * Register treatment in 16-bit __cdecl, 32-bit __cdecl and 64-bit msabi:
 *
 * | Register     | 16-bit      | 32-bit     | 64-bit          | ASM template |
 * | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------ |
 * | EAX, RAX     | volatile    | volatile   | volatile        | volatile     |
 * | EBX, RBX     | volatile    | preserved  | preserved       | both         |

 * | R14          | volatile    | volatile   | preserved       | preserved(*) |
 * | R15          | volatile    | volatile   | preserved       | preserved(*) |
 * | RFLAGS.DF    | =0          | =0         | =0              | =0           |

 * | SS           | preserved   | preserved  | preserved       | preserved    |
 *
 * The 'both' here means that we preserve it wrt to our caller, while at the
 * same time assuming anything we call will clobber it.
 *
 * The 'preserved(*)' marking of R12-R15 indicates that they'll be preserved in
 * 64-bit mode, but may be changed in certain cases when running 32-bit or
 * 16-bit code.  This is especially true if switching CPU mode, e.g. from 32-bit
 * protected mode to 32-bit long mode.
 *
 * Return values are returned in the xAX register, but with the following
 * caveats for values larger than ARCH_BITS:
 *      - 16-bit code:
 *          - 32-bit values are returned in AX:DX, where AX holds bits 15:0 and
 *            DX bits 31:16.
 *          - 64-bit values are returned in DX:CX:BX:AX, where DX holds bits
 *            15:0, CX bits 31:16, BX bits 47:32, and AX bits 63:48.
 *      - 32-bit code:
 *          - 64-bit values are returned in EAX:EDX, where eax holds the least
 *            significant bits.
